title: Announcing GoPHP7-ext
---

Good news: PHP7 is coming and it's really really fast!

Bad news: The architectural changes in PHP7 mean that every PHP extension will need updating, and some of them (even the core ones) are already rather neglected and maintainerless.

## The plan

Get the community to help!  You don't need to be a C developer to help us work out what works and what doesn't for our existing extensions.  We'll be writing comprehensive guides (collaboratively, please expect to edit wikis and open pull requests) to make sure that we can all get involved in a useful way and make sure that PHP7 gets off to the best possible start.

We'll be updating this blog as our emphasis changes.  Right now, PHP7 is still pre-alpha so we're working on collecting information on existing extensions, and working out which compile, which have tests and documentation, and which have issues (some with a captial I).  To get involved, visit the [homepage](/gophp7-ext/) and/or IRC with us in #gophp7-ext on freenode.
