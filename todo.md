title: Go PHP 7 Extensions

# GoPHP7-ext Todo List

These tasks need input from specific people, or more thought, before they can are useful for the wider community to get involved with.

## Documentation for extension developers

Write more documentation for new extension devs to use, things like best practices, setups for testing on travis/appveyor, how to get windows extensions compiling, etc

## PHP7 Best Practice Documentation

Work on "new" best practices for php7 - namespacing extensions, proper api design, code layout and standards, so that extensions are nice and clean (think PSR's for extensions - optional but makes life awesome)

## Make Installation A Breeze

Work with composer and pickle folks (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/pickle) so that installation with composer/pickle is even better than with pear/pecl

## Central Packages Repository

Have a packagist like place to list all these disparate extensions (pecl has license restrictions, for example) - maybe even packagist itself

## Offer Pre-built Versions

Create places to have binary compiles for systems - ubuntu/debian ppas, homebrew stuff, etc so that getting binary/easily compiling versions on a system is something all extensions can have with minimal work
