# Extensions Catalog

This is a mammoth page on our wiki: <https://github.com/lornajane/gophp7-ext/wiki/extensions-catalog>.

It is divided into sections by extension type:

 * Core
 * pecl.php.net
 * pecl (not php.net)
 * Other extensions

## How you can help

We need to list as many extensions here as we can find information about.  Each extension needs a row in the table with the following (mostly yes/no) information:

 * Name
 * Homepage/location
 * Has maintainers
 * Has tests
 * Has docs
 * Works on PHP5 (newest PHP 5)
 * Works on PHP7
 * Is good on PHP 7
 * Details - link out to a new wiki page and write more about the state of the project and what needs doing before the answers are all "yes"

You can edit our existing template line (the pipes don't need to line up) to create your row entry:

```

| Homepage/location | Has maintainers | Has tests | Has docs | Works on PHP5 | Works on PHP7 | Is good on PHP 7 | Details |

```

Please fill in as much information as you can ... and where there are gaps, guess whose job it is to fill them?

## Finding Extensions
